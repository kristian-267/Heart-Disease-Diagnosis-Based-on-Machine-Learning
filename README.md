# Heart-Disease-Diagnosis-Based-on-Machine-Learning
## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the development and sharing of machine learning models focused on diagnosing heart disease. Our goal is to harness the power of advanced algorithms to improve the accuracy and efficiency of heart disease detection, potentially leading to earlier interventions and better patient outcomes.

## Files
- `code/descriptive.py`: Offers descriptive statistical analysis.
- `code/regression.py`: Implements regression models: ANN and Linear Regression.
- `code/classification.py`: Implements classification models: Classification Tree and Logistic Regression.

## Installation
Ensure you have installed Python 3.10
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kristian-267/Heart-Disease-Diagnosis-Based-on-Machine-Learning.git
cd Heart-Disease-Diagnosis-Based-on-Machine-Learning
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run each Python script to perform the respective analysis. Ensure you have the necessary data files in the `data/` directory.
